# TODO
* At the moment, projects/theBlog is showing the default "Work in Progress!" despite having content, probably inheriting from +layout or something.

### For deployment
https://www.okupter.com/blog/deploy-sveltekit-website-to-github-pages

### Projects page
Maybe replace current cards with gallery-esq cards:
- 2 cards per row, n/2 rows to fill screen
- screenshot of project in background 
- white font on top of background for name of project
- on hover, zoom in on background and bolden(?) text more
